# hello-world

my name is Paul Bock.  

I'm a program manager for Mercy Corps; previously I was with Umpqua Bank, Nike, Yahoo, and FedEx.  My careers have spanned training, to project manager, to marketing...my current passion is creating user-centric websites that help better positioning the organizations strengths to solve customer needs.  

I also really enjoy hiking.  

And wildflowers.  

And good pizza and beer.
